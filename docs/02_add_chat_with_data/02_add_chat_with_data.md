# Exercise 02 - Add chat with your data

## Lab Scenario

One of the most natural ways to integrate Azure OpenAI in an existing solution is to incorporate chat into an existing system. For this solution to bring the most value to an organization, however, the chat service must have access to information that may be proprietary or otherwise confidential. In this exercise, we will add custom data to augment an existing Azure OpenAI chat deployment, allowing customer service agents to review customer data in a natural language format.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Prepare a dataset in Azure Blob Storage for ingestion into Azure OpenAI
* Ingest data from Azure Blob Storage into Azure OpenAI via Azure AI Search
* Test chat completions using the Chat playground in Azure OpenAI
* Incorporate chat completions in a Streamlit application

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
