# Task 02 - Install client tools (20 minutes)

## Introduction

There are several client tools that you will use throughout this lab. These are standard tools for teams working with AI services from both Microsoft and other companies. The second task in this exercise is to prepare a machine--whether a virtual machine or your local computer--to perform these exercises.

## Description

In this task, you will ensure that you have a particular set of tools installed on your own computer.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Ensure that you have the following software installed:
   1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension for Visual Studio Code. Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio installed, you can use that.
   2. [A Git client](https://git-scm.com/download/). One option is to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
   3. [Python 3.10 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend you install the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://anaconda.com/download), though you can use a standard installation of Python.
2. Clone [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-automation-practices-using-Azure-OpenAI) to your local machine.

## Success Criteria

- You have installed all necessary tools.
- You have forked the GitHub repository and cloned it to your local machine or virtual machine.
